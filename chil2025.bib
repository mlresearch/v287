  abstract  = {Disease progression models are widely used to inform the diagnosis and treatment of many progressive diseases. However, a significant limitation of existing models is that they do not account for health disparities that can bias the observed data. To address this, we develop an interpretable Bayesian disease progression model that captures three key health disparities: certain patient populations may (1) start receiving care only when their disease is more severe, (2) experience faster disease progression even while receiving care, or (3) receive follow-up care less frequently conditional on disease severity. We show theoretically and empirically that failing to account for disparities produces biased estimates of severity (underestimating severity for disadvantaged groups, for example). On a dataset of heart failure patients, we show that our model can identify groups that face each type of health disparity, and that accounting for these disparities meaningfully shifts which patients are considered high-risk.}

To bridge this gap, we introduce a system, named ReXKG, which extracts structured information from processed reports to construct a comprehensive radiology knowledge graph. We then propose three metrics to evaluate the similarity of nodes, distribution of edges, and coverage of subgraphs across various knowledge graphs. Using these metrics, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of AI-generated and human-written radiology reports, assessing the performance of both specialist and generalist models. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current AI models in report generation, offering valuable insights for improving model performance and clinical applicability.}

KEEP first generates embeddings from knowledge graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships. Evaluations on structured EHR from UK Biobank demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional and LLM-based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical outcomes. Moreover, KEEP's minimal computational requirements make it particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments.}

Our results demonstrate that convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches consistently achieve superior accuracy compared to other network architectures. Additionally, we observed the presence of fragmented segments in the delineation results.  To address this issue, we explored post-processing techniques to consolidate or eliminate fragmented segments using an optimal configuration, leading to performance improvements.  Furthermore, by analyzing performance variations across different waveform labels, we provide critical insights into key considerations for ECG segmentation tasks. Notably, our findings also reveal that larger model sizes do not necessarily correlate with better performance.  Based on our findings, we propose a set of practical guidelines for leveraging segmentation models in ECG delineation, offering valuable direction for future research and clinical applications.}

The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the diverse nature of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for developing robust and adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a novel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich knowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic approach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason about ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks compared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with limited ECG leads. For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves an accuracy of 84.6%, 77.3%, and 69.6% on single verify, choose and query question types, respectively. These results highlight the potential of our method to enhance clinical ECG interpretation by combining signal processing with the nuanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, particularly in data-constrained scenarios.}

Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations, and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individuals' privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize across different hospitals, a long-standing issue in the field. In this work, we evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize across diverse hospital settings.}

  abstract  = {Multiaccuracy was previously demonstrated to improve subpopulation calibration in medical prediction models, ensuring fairness towards subpopulations. Medical prediction models often experience degraded performance due to distribution shifts (e.g. changes in input data resulting from changes in space or time), but the effectiveness of multiaccuracy in ensuring medical predictors' fairness under these circumstances was suggested theoretically but has yet to be studied empirically. To explore this, we trained prediction models using real-world data, applied an adaptation of multiaccuracy as a post-processing step to intersecting subpopulations defined by combinations of protected features such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, and tested the performance of the models on target test sets from distributions different than the development cohorts. The results demonstrated that the improvement in subpopulation calibration achieved by multiaccuracy was maintained in the target distribution over two experiments, simulating spatial-temporal and migration-induced distribution shifts. On average, over the two experiments, Calibration in the Large mean error and variance measures were reduced by 71.8\% and 70.7\% on the target distributions after applying multiaccuracy, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of post-processing for multiaccuracy as a tool for enhancing the fairness and reliability of medical prediction models across diverse populations, even under circumstances of major distribution shifts.}

To address the limited availability of high-quality wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) datasets, WatchSleepNet leveraged inter-beat interval (IBI) signals as a shared representation across polysomnography (PSG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) modalities.

  abstract  = {Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly employed to generate health related traits (phenotypes) for genetic discovery, either by imputing existing phenotypes into larger cohorts or by creating novel phenotypes. While these ML-derived phenotypes can significantly increase sample size, and thereby empower genetic discovery, they can also inflate the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent research has focused on developing estimators that leverage both true and machine-learned phenotypes to properly control false positives. Our work complements these efforts by exploring how the true positive rate (TPR) and FDR depend on the causal relationships among the inputs to the ML model, the true phenotypes, and the environment.  Using a simulation-based framework, we study causal architectures in which the machine-learned proxy phenotype is derived from biomarkers (i.e. ML model input features) either causally upstream or downstream of the target phenotype (ML model output). We show that no inflation of the false discovery rate occurs when the proxy phenotype is generated from upstream biomarkers, but that false discoveries can occur when the proxy phenotype is generated from downstream biomarkers. Next, we show that power to detect genetic variants truly associated with the target trait depends on its genetic component and correlation with the proxy trait. However, the source of the correlation is key to evaluating a proxy phenotype's utility for genetic discovery. We demonstrate that evaluating machine-learned proxy phenotypes using out-of-sample predictive performance (e.g. test $R^2$) provides a poor lens on utility. This is because overall predictive performance does not differentiate between genetic and environmental components. In addition to parsing these properties of machine-learned phenotypes via simulations, we further illustrate them using real-world data from the UK Biobank.}

  abstract  = {Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects are valuable when making treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-compliance (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional frond-door adjustment (CFD) can both recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. Therefore, which is more suitable depends on their estimation variance. From existing literature, it is unclear which of the two produces lower-variance estimates. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small. Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-compliance.}

Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field.}

Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains consistent inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. This work establishes a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.}

However, the reliability, faithfulness, and consistency of attention mechanisms as an interpretability tool in high-dimensional clinical time series data require further investigation. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of consistency and faithfulness of attention mechanisms in deep learning models applied to high-dimensional clinical time-series data. Specifically, we trained 1000 different variants of an attention-based LSTM model architecture with random initializations to analyze the consistency of attention scores across mortality prediction and patient severity group classification. Our findings revealed significant inconsistencies in attention scores for individual samples across the thousand model variants. Visual inspection of attention weight distributions indicated that the attention mechanism did not consistently focus on the same feature-time pairs, challenging the assumption of faithfulness and reliability in model interpretability. The observed inconsistencies in per-sample attention weights suggest that attention mechanisms are unreliable as an interpretability tool for clinical decision-making tasks involving high-dimensional time-series data. While attention mechanisms may enhance model performance metrics, they often fail to produce clinically meaningful and consistent interpretations, limiting their utility in healthcare settings where transparency is critical for informed decision-making.}

We further uncover key demographic and clinical factors associated with non-adherence, as well as patient-reported reasons including side effects and difficulties obtaining refills.

This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.}

Using two time series data targets (continuous glucose monitoring, Loop dataset; heart rate, All of Us dataset) we simulated missingness for each mechanism, at a range of missingness percentages (5-30%) and tested 12 imputation methods. We evaluated accuracy with multiple metrics including root mean square error (RMSE) and bias. We found that overall, accuracy was significantly better on MCAR than on MAR and NMAR, despite many methods being developed for those mechanisms. Linear interpolation had the lowest RMSE with all mechanisms and for all demographic groups, with low bias. This study shows that current evaluation practices do not provide an accurate picture of real-world performance with realistic patterns of missingness. Future research is needed to develop evaluation practices that better capture real-world accuracy, and methods that better address real-world mechanisms.}

  abstract  = {Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyography (EMG), demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.}

Case reports serve as key but computationally underutilized resources to inform diagnosis.

Large Language Models (LLMs) may enable scalable dense information extraction from case reports but are rarely evaluated for this task. We introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-crafted dataset for dense information extraction of case reports (focusing on IEMs). Using this dataset, we assess various models and promptings, introducing novel strategies of category-specific prompting and \textbf{subheading-filtered data integration}. Zero-shot chain-of-thought offers little advantage over zero-shot prompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment to benchmark. Open-source Qwen2.5:7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management, while highlighting areas for improvement, such as LLM's limitation in recognizing negative findings for differential diagnosis. This work advances LLM-driven clinical NLP, paving the way for scalable, privacy-conscious medical AI applications.}

In order to combine the strengths of both MALDI-TOF and WGS, we present MSMAP, the first machine learning framework that establishes a mapping between MALDI-TOF mass spectra and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances obtained from WGS analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMAP in retrieving WGS-defined outbreak clusters on synthetic mass spectrum data and on proprietary data with paired MALDI-TOF and SNP information. The results show that MSMAP augments MALDI-TOF with the discriminatory power of WGS, thus bridging their utility gap and paving the way toward fast, accurate and cost-effective outbreak cluster detection.}

We frame this problem in the context of survival analysis, looking at the time until the earliest of several types of adverse outcomes (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail booking)--we refer to this time duration as the adverse event time. We apply standard causal inference tools (T-learner, S-learner, and nearest neighbor matching) with various survival models to estimate individual and average treatment effects in terms of differences in mean adverse event times, where the treatment corresponds to medication non-adherence. We repeat our analysis using different amounts of longitudinal information available per individual (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using real data from a county's administrative records, our results show strong evidence that medication non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse outcomes, advancing the onset of an adverse event by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies confirm that risk scores provided by the county account for key confounders, as their removal amplifies the estimated effects of non-adherence. Finally, subgroup analyses by medication formulation (injectable vs. oral) and by specific medication type consistently show that non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the clinical importance of medication adherence in delaying severe psychiatric crises and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can yield policy-relevant insights in complex healthcare settings. We caution that although we use causal inference tools, we only make associative claims; we discuss the validity of some assumptions that would enable us to rigorously convert our claims into causal ones.}

EHR-based TTE relies on recorded data that proxy actual drug exposures and outcomes. While prior work has proposed various methods to improve EHR data quality, here we investigate the under-utilized consideration that encounters with a primary care provider (PCP) may result in more accurate data in the EHR. Patients with a PCP within the EHR network being studied tend to have more encounters overall and a greater proportion of the types of encounters that yield comprehensive and up-to-date records. By contrasting data for patients with and without a PCP in the considered EHR network, we demonstrate how PCP status affects EHR data quality. Through a case study, we then empirically examine the impact on TTE of including a PCP status feature either in the propensity score and outcome models or as an eligibility criterion for cohort selection, versus ignoring it. Specifically, we compare the estimated effects of two first-line antidiabetic drug classes on the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. We find that the estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the consideration of PCP status, particularly when used as an eligibility criterion. Our work suggests that further researching the role of PCP status may improve the design of pragmatic trials.}

HeadCT-ONE compares normalized entities and relations, allowing for controllable weighting of different entity types or specific entities.

Our results demonstrate how HeadCT-ONE enables more flexible, controllable, and granular automated evaluation of head CT reports.}

However, in electronic health records (EHR) data, long-term labels may not be available for contemporary patient cohorts. Given the dynamic nature of clinical practice, models that rely on historical training data may not perform optimally. In this work, we frame the problem as a positive--unlabeled domain adaptation task, where we seek to adapt from a fully labeled source domain (e.g., historical data) to a partially labeled target domain (e.g., contemporary data). We propose an adversarial framework that includes three core components: (1) Overall Alignment, to match feature distributions between source and target domains; (2) Partial Alignment, to map source negatives to unlabeled target samples; and (3) Conditional Alignment, to address conditional shift using available positive labels in the target domain. We evaluate our method on a benchmark digit classification task (SVHN-MNIST), and two real-world EHR applications: prediction of one-year mortality post COVID-19, and long-term prediction of neurodevelopmental conditions (NDC) in children. In all settings, our approach consistently outperforms baseline models and, in most cases, achieves performance close to an oracle model trained with fully observed labels.}

  abstract  = {Estimating the impact of continuous treatment variables (e.g., dosage amount) on binary outcomes presents significant challenges in modeling and estimation because many existing approaches make strong assumptions that do not hold for certain continuous treatment variables. For instance, traditional logistic regression makes strong linearity assumptions that do not hold for continuous treatment variables like time of initiation. In this work, we propose a semiparametric regression framework that decomposes effects into two interpretable components: a prognostic score that captures baseline outcome risk based on a combination of clinical, genetic, and sociodemographic features, and a treatment-interaction score that flexibly models the optimal treatment level via a nonparametric link function. By connecting these two parametric scores with Nadaraya--Watson regression, our approach is both interpretable and flexible. The potential of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations that show empirical estimation convergence. We conclude by applying our approach to a real-world case study using the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium (IWPC) dataset to show our approach's clinical utility by deriving personalized warfarin dosing recommendations that integrate both genetic and clinical data, providing insights towards enhancing patient safety and therapeutic efficacy in anticoagulation therapy.}

For both use cases, we investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo. Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage. Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and misinformation appear, with implications for future dataset composition.}

We introduce a novel constrained multi-objective evolutionary machine learning (ML) optimization framework, SET (Scoring-table Evolutionary Tuning), that fine-tunes established clinical scoring tables to enhance performance while maintaining familiarity. SET works by iteratively making small constrained changes to the original table to improve performance across multiple metrics, while maintaining a similar structure, ensuring that minimal adjustments are made. This is in contrast to ML-based proposals that replace scoring tables with entirely new models or tables, which may encounter barriers to clinical adoption. Extensive evaluations across 8 established scoring tables and cohorts demonstrate that SET allows existing clinically-trusted scoring tables to adapt to variations in demography, enhancing performance. We also show that in situations with incomplete data availability of key clinical variables, SET can still augment scoring tables and perform competitively. Additionally, SET can also augment existing tables to incorporate new cohort-relevant features.}

We also rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transfomer-based model optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly in identifying converter subjects--individuals transitioning to more severe disease stages--an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal prediction.

We systematically analyze artifact biases in three benchmark datasets: ISIC 2018, HAM10000, and PH2. Our findings reveal that whole-image training outperforms lesion-only or background-only approaches, low-frequency features are essential for melanoma prediction, and classifiers are more sensitive to perturbations for the artifacts of ink markings, rulers, and patches.
