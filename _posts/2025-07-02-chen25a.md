title: Conditional Front-door Adjustment for Heterogeneous Treatment Assignment Effect
  Estimation Under Non-compliance
abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects are valuable when
  making treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-compliance (e.g., patients
  do not adhere to their assigned treatment), the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD)
  and the conditional frond-door adjustment (CFD) can both recover unbiased estimates
  of the treatment assignment effects. Therefore, which is more suitable depends on
  their estimation variance. From existing literature, it is unclear which of the
  two produces lower-variance estimates. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically
  and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true
  effect of treatment assignment is small. Additionally, since CFD requires estimating
  multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network
  that implements CFD with joint modeling. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation
  error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines.
  Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment
  assignment effect estimation under non-compliance.
