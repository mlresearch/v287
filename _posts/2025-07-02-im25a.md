title: 'LabTOP: A Unified Model for Lab Test Outcome Prediction on Electronic Health
  Records'
abstract: Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient
  conditions. However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results
  may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose  LabTOP,
  a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging autoregressive generative
  modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a
  subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous
  numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three
  publicly available EHR datasets, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods,
  including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language
  models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness
  of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable
  framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical
  decision support and early detection of critical conditions.
