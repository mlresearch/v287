title: 'MedMod: Multimodal Benchmark for Medical Prediction Tasks with Electronic
  Health Records and Chest X-Ray Scans'
abstract: 'Multimodal machine learning provides a myriad of opportunities for developing
  models that integrate multiple modalities and mimic decision-making in the real-world,
  such as in medical settings. However, benchmarks involving multimodal medical data
  are scarce, especially routinely collected modalities such as Electronic Health
  Records (EHR) and Chest X-ray images (CXR). To contribute towards advancing multimodal
  learning in tackling real-world prediction tasks, we present MedMod, a multimodal
  medical benchmark with EHR and CXR using publicly available datasets MIMIC-IV and
  MIMIC-CXR, respectively. MedMod comprises five clinical prediction tasks: clinical
  conditions, in-hospital mortality, decompensation, length of stay, and radiological
  findings. We extensively evaluate several multimodal supervised learning models
  and self-supervised learning frameworks, making all of our code and models open-source.'
