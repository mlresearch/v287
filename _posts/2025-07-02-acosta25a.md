title: 'HeadCT-ONE: Enabling Granular and Controllable Automated Evaluation of Head
  CT Radiology Report Generation'
abstract: We present Head CT Ontology Normalized Evaluation (HeadCT-ONE), a metric
  for evaluating head CT report generation through ontology-normalized entity and
  relation extraction. HeadCT-ONE enhances current information extraction derived
  metrics (such as RadGraph F1) by implementing entity normalization through domain-specific
  ontologies, addressing radiological language variability. HeadCT-ONE compares normalized
  entities and relations, allowing for controllable weighting of different entity
  types or specific entities. Through experiments on head CT reports from three health
  systems, we show that HeadCT-ONE’s normalization and weighting approach improves
  the capture of semantically equivalent reports, better distinguishes between normal
  and abnormal reports, and aligns with radiologists’ assessment of clinically significant
  errors, while offering flexibility to prioritize specific aspects of report content.
  Our results demonstrate how HeadCT-ONE enables more flexible, controllable, and
  granular automated evaluation of head CT reports.
