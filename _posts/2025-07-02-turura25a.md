title: 'The Latentverse: An Open-Source Benchmarking Toolkit for Evaluating Latent
  Representations'
abstract: Self-supervised representation learning is a powerful approach for extracting
  meaningful features without relying on large amounts of labeled data, making it
  particularly valuable in fields like healthcare. This enables pretrained models
  to be shared and fine-tuned with minimal data for various downstream applications.
  However, evaluating the quality and behavior of these representations remains challenging.
  To address this, we introduce Latentverse, an open-source library and web-based
  platform for evaluating latent representations. Latentverse generates detailed reports
  with visualizations and metrics that provide a comprehensive perspective on different
  properties of representations, such as clustering, disentanglement, generalization,
  expressiveness, and robustness. It also allows for the comparison of different representations,
  enabling developers to refine model architectures and helping users assess how well
  an embedding model aligns with the requirements of their specific applications.
