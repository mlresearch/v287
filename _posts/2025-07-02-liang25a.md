title: 'Treatment Non-Adherence Bias in Clinical Machine Learning: A Real-World Study
  on Hypertension Medication'
abstract: Machine learning systems trained on electronic health records (EHRs) increasingly
  guide treatment decisions, but their reliability depends on the critical assumption
  that patients follow the prescribed treatments recorded in EHRs. Using EHR data
  from 3,623 hypertension patients, we investigate how treatment non-adherence introduces
  implicit bias that can fundamentally distort both causal inference and predictive
  modeling. By extracting patient adherence information from clinical notes using
  a large language model, we identify 786 patients (21.7%) with medication non-adherence.
  We further uncover key demographic and clinical factors associated with non-adherence,
  as well as patient-reported reasons including side effects and difficulties obtaining
  refills. Our findings demonstrate that this implicit bias can not only reverse estimated
  treatment effects, but also degrade model performance by up to 5% while disproportionately
  affecting vulnerable populations by exacerbating disparities in decision outcomes
  and model error rates. This highlights the importance of accounting for treatment
  non-adherence in developing responsible and equitable clinical machine learning
  systems.
