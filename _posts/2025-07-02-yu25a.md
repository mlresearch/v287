title: Self-Explaining Hypergraph Neural Networks for Diagnosis Prediction
abstract: The burgeoning volume of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled deep
  learning models to excel in predictive healthcare. However, for high-stakes applications
  such as diagnosis prediction, model interpretability remains paramount. Existing
  deep learning diagnosis prediction models with intrinsic interpretability often
  assign attention weights to every past diagnosis or hospital visit, providing explanations
  lacking flexibility and succinctness. In this paper, we introduce SHy, a self-explaining
  hypergraph neural network model, designed to offer personalized, concise and faithful
  explanations that allow for interventions from clinical experts. By modeling each
  patient as a unique hypergraph and employing a message-passing mechanism, SHy captures
  higher-order disease interactions and extracts distinct temporal phenotypes as personalized
  explanations. It also addresses the incompleteness of the EHR data by accounting
  for essential false negatives in the original diagnosis record. A qualitative case
  study and extensive quantitative evaluations on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate
  the superior predictive performance and interpretability of SHy over existing state-of-the-art
  models.
