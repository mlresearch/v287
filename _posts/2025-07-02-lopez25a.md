title: 'Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Survey'
abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing the robustness,
  reliability, and interpretability of Machine Learning (ML) systems for healthcare,
  optimizing resources and improving patient care. Despite the emergence of ML-based
  clinical decision support tools, the lack of principled quantification of uncertainty
  in ML models remains a major challenge. Current reviews have a narrow focus on analyzing
  the state-of-the-art UQ in specific healthcare domains without systematically evaluating
  method efficacy across different stages of model development, and despite a growing
  body of research, its implementation in healthcare applications remains limited.
  Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of current UQ in
  healthcare, offering an informed framework that highlights how different methods
  can be integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline including data processing,
  training and evaluation. We also highlight the most popular methods used in healthcare
  and novel approaches from other domains that hold potential for future adoption
  in the medical context. We expect this study will provide a clear overview of the
  challenges and opportunities of implementing UQ in the ML pipeline for healthcare,
  guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable techniques to enhance
  the reliability, safety and trust from patients and clinicians on ML-driven healthcare
  solutions.
