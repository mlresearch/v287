title: 'Test-Time Calibration: A Framework for Personalized Test-Time Adaptation in
  Real-World Biosignals'
abstract: 'Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been widely used to enhance model
  robustness by continuously updating pre-trained models with unlabeled target data.  However,
  in real-world biosignal applications-where factors such as age, lifestyle, and comorbidities
  induce significant variabilityâ€“traditional TTA often falls short in addressing personalization
  needs.  To satisfy such needs, we introduce a novel Test-Time Calibration (TTC)
  framework that integrates continuous self-supervised adaptation on unlabeled samples
  with periodic supervised calibration using the sporadically available ground-truth
  labels.  Our approach leverages a model equipped with dual heads for supervised
  learning (SL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), and further incorporates a dual
  buffer along with a weighted batch sampling strategy to effectively manage and utilize
  both data types during the test phase.  We evaluate our framework on two distinct
  datasets: the publicly available PulseDB, a benchmark for cuff-less blood pressure
  estimation, and a private ICU dataset collected from critically ill patients.  Experimental
  results demonstrate that our approach improves blood pressure prediction accuracy
  and robustness, highlighting its suitability for dynamic, personalized biosignal
  applications.'
