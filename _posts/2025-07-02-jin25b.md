title: A Study of Artifacts on Melanoma Classification under Diffusion-Based Perturbations
abstract: 'In melanoma classification, deep learning models have been shown to rely
  on non-medical artifacts (e.g., surgical markings) rather than clinically relevant
  features (e.g., lesion asymmetry), compromising their generalizability. In this
  work, we investigate the impact of artifacts on melanoma classification under two
  settings: (1) input disruptions, such as bounding boxes and frequency-based filtering,
  which isolate artifacts by region or frequency, and (2) a novel diffusion-based
  perturbation method that selectively introduces isolated artifacts into images,
  generating controlled pairs for direct comparison. We systematically analyze artifact
  biases in three benchmark datasets: ISIC 2018, HAM10000, and PH2. Our findings reveal
  that whole-image training outperforms lesion-only or background-only approaches,
  low-frequency features are essential for melanoma prediction, and classifiers are
  more sensitive to perturbations for the artifacts of ink markings, rulers, and patches.
  These results emphasize the need for systematic artifact assessment and provide
  insights for improving the robustness of melanoma classification models.'
