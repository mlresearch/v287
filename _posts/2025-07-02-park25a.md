title: Benchmarking ECG Delineation using Deep Neural Network-based Semantic Segmentation
  Models
abstract: Accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation is essential for automated
  cardiac diagnosis, enabling the precise identification of key waveforms such as
  the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. This study presents the first comprehensive
  benchmarking of neural network-based semantic segmentation models for ECG delineation,
  evaluating their accuracy, resource efficiency, and robustness across both public
  and private datasets. Our results demonstrate that convolutional neural network
  (CNN)-based approaches consistently achieve superior accuracy compared to other
  network architectures. Additionally, we observed the presence of fragmented segments
  in the delineation results.  To address this issue, we explored post-processing
  techniques to consolidate or eliminate fragmented segments using an optimal configuration,
  leading to performance improvements.  Furthermore, by analyzing performance variations
  across different waveform labels, we provide critical insights into key considerations
  for ECG segmentation tasks. Notably, our findings also reveal that larger model
  sizes do not necessarily correlate with better performance.  Based on our findings,
  we propose a set of practical guidelines for leveraging segmentation models in ECG
  delineation, offering valuable direction for future research and clinical applications.
