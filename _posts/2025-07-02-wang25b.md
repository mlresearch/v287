title: 'CaReAQA: A Cardiac and Respiratory Audio Question Answering Model for Open-Ended
  Diagnostic Reasoning'
abstract: 'Medical audio signals, such as heart and lung sounds, play a crucial role
  in clinical diagnosis. However, analyzing these signals remains challenging: traditional
  methods rely on handcrafted features or supervised deep learning models that demand
  extensive labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and applicability. To address
  these issues, we propose CaReAQA, an audio-language model that integrates a foundation
  audio model with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling clinically
  relevant, open-ended diagnostic responses. Alongside CaReAQA, we introduce CaReSound,
  a benchmark dataset of annotated medical audio recordings enriched with metadata
  and paired question-answer examples, intended to drive progress in diagnostic reasoning
  research. Evaluation results show that CaReAQA achieves $86.2%$ accuracy on open-ended
  diagnostic reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models. It also generalizes well
  to closed-ended classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $56.9%$ on
  unseen datasets. These findings highlight the transformative potential of integrating
  audio analysis with language-based reasoning to address key challenges in medical
  diagnostics, opening new possibilities for scalable, data-efficient AI systems capable
  of supporting real-world clinical decision-making.'
