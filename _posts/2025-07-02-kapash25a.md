title: Multiaccuracy for Subpopulation Calibration Over Distribution Shift in Medical
  Prediction Models
abstract: Multiaccuracy was previously demonstrated to improve subpopulation calibration
  in medical prediction models, ensuring fairness towards subpopulations. Medical
  prediction models often experience degraded performance due to distribution shifts
  (e.g. changes in input data resulting from changes in space or time), but the effectiveness
  of multiaccuracy in ensuring medical predictorsâ€™ fairness under these circumstances
  was suggested theoretically but has yet to be studied empirically. To explore this,
  we trained prediction models using real-world data, applied an adaptation of multiaccuracy
  as a post-processing step to intersecting subpopulations defined by combinations
  of protected features such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, and tested
  the performance of the models on target test sets from distributions different than
  the development cohorts. The results demonstrated that the improvement in subpopulation
  calibration achieved by multiaccuracy was maintained in the target distribution
  over two experiments, simulating spatial-temporal and migration-induced distribution
  shifts. On average, over the two experiments, Calibration in the Large mean error
  and variance measures were reduced by 71.8% and 70.7% on the target distributions
  after applying multiaccuracy, respectively. These findings highlight the potential
  of post-processing for multiaccuracy as a tool for enhancing the fairness and reliability
  of medical prediction models across diverse populations, even under circumstances
  of major distribution shifts.
