title: Benchmarking Missing Data Imputation Methods for Time Series Using Real-World
  Test Cases
abstract: Missing data is pervasive in healthcare. Many imputation methods exist to
  fill in missing values, yet most were evaluated using randomly deleted values rather
  than the actual mechanisms they were designed to address. We aimed to determine
  real-world accuracy on all types of missing data (missing completely at random,
  MCAR; missing at random, MAR; and not missing at random, NMAR) for state of the
  art and commonly used imputation methods. Using two time series data targets (continuous
  glucose monitoring, Loop dataset; heart rate, All of Us dataset) we simulated missingness
  for each mechanism, at a range of missingness percentages (5-30%) and tested 12
  imputation methods. We evaluated accuracy with multiple metrics including root mean
  square error (RMSE) and bias. We found that overall, accuracy was significantly
  better on MCAR than on MAR and NMAR, despite many methods being developed for those
  mechanisms. Linear interpolation had the lowest RMSE with all mechanisms and for
  all demographic groups, with low bias. This study shows that current evaluation
  practices do not provide an accurate picture of real-world performance with realistic
  patterns of missingness. Future research is needed to develop evaluation practices
  that better capture real-world accuracy, and methods that better address real-world
  mechanisms.
