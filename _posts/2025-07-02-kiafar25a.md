title: Feasibility of Immersive Virtual Reality and Customized Robotics with Wearable
  Sensors for Upper Extremity Training
abstract: Upper limb impairment significantly impacts daily activities and quality
  of life. Traditional robotic systems have been widely used in neurological rehabilitation
  applications. However, its adoption has been limited to laboratory and clinical
  settings due to cost constraints. Our study aimed to assess the feasibility and
  usability of a cost-effective virtual reality (VR) for home-based upper limb training.
  We used a customized wearable sleeve sensor to assess the hand and elbow joint movements
  objectively.   A pilot user study (n = 16) with healthy participants involved evaluating
  system usability, task load, and presence within two conditions of VR alone and
  VR combined with a customized inverse kinematics robot arm (KinArm).  Results of
  statistical analysis using a two-way repeated measure (ANOVA) revealed no significant
  difference between conditions in task completion time. However, significant differences
  were observed in the normalized number of mistakes and recorded elbow joint angles  between
  tasks.  Our findings highlight the potential advantages of an immersive and multi-sensory
  approach towards performance assessment.  This study explores avenues for the development
  of potentially cost-effective, tailored, and engaging environments for home-based
  therapy applications.
