title: Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient’s Chest X-ray Images based
  on Electronic Health Records
abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals
  to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative
  models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic
  synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using
  single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding
  reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for
  capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework,
  EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent
  medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically
  tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned
  on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate
  the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency,
  demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates
  high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal
  changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support
  clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and
  treatment planning in the medical field.
