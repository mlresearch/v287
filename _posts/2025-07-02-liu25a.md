title: Bridging the utility gap between MALDI-TOF and WGS for affordable outbreak
  cluster detection
abstract: Rapid and accurate detection of emerging outbreak clusters can help contain
  the spread of diseases with epidemic potential. Among the available pathogen matching
  methods that can be used to support the task, whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers
  the highest discriminatory power but is expensive and time-consuming. On the other
  hand,  Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionizationâ€“Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
  spectrometry is gaining attention for being a rapid and cost-effective, albeit less
  precise, alternative. In order to combine the strengths of both MALDI-TOF and WGS,
  we present MSMAP, the first machine learning framework that establishes a mapping
  between MALDI-TOF mass spectra and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances
  obtained from WGS analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMAP in retrieving
  WGS-defined outbreak clusters on synthetic mass spectrum data and on proprietary
  data with paired MALDI-TOF and SNP information. The results show that MSMAP augments
  MALDI-TOF with the discriminatory power of WGS, thus bridging their utility gap
  and paving the way toward fast, accurate and cost-effective outbreak cluster detection.
