title: 'CaseReportBench: An LLM Benchmark Dataset for Dense Information Extraction
  in Clinical Case Reports'
abstract: Rare diseases, including Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM), pose significant
  diagnostic challenges. Case reports serve as key but computationally underutilized
  resources to inform diagnosis. Clinical dense information extraction refers to organizing
  medical information into structured predefined categories. Large Language Models
  (LLMs) may enable scalable dense information extraction from case reports but are
  rarely evaluated for this task. We introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-crafted
  dataset for dense information extraction of case reports (focusing on IEMs). Using
  this dataset, we assess various models and promptings, introducing novel strategies
  of category-specific prompting and \textbf{subheading-filtered data integration}.
  Zero-shot chain-of-thought offers little advantage over zero-shot prompting. Category-specific
  prompting improves alignment to benchmark. Open-source Qwen2.5:7B outperforms GPT-4o
  for this task. Our clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant
  details from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management, while
  highlighting areas for improvement, such as LLMâ€™s limitation in recognizing negative
  findings for differential diagnosis. This work advances LLM-driven clinical NLP,
  paving the way for scalable, privacy-conscious medical AI applications.
