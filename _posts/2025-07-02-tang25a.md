title: Electrocardiogram–Language Model for Few-Shot Question Answering with Meta
  Learning
abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation requires specialized expertise, often
  involving synthesizing insights from ECG signals with complex clinical queries posed
  in natural language. The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the diverse nature
  of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for developing robust and
  adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a novel multimodal meta-learning
  method for few-shot ECG question answering, addressing the challenge of limited
  labeled data while leveraging the rich knowledge encoded within large language models
  (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic approach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen
  LLM (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language
  model to reason about ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks compared
  to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with limited ECG leads.
  For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves
  an accuracy of 84.6%, 77.3%, and 69.6% on single verify, choose and query question
  types, respectively. These results highlight the potential of our method to enhance
  clinical ECG interpretation by combining signal processing with the nuanced language
  understanding capabilities of LLMs, particularly in data-constrained scenarios.
