title: 'The Impact of Medication Non-adherence on Adverse Outcomes: Evidence from
  Schizophrenia Patients via Survival Analysis'
abstract: This study aims to quantify the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
  medications and adverse outcomes among individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
  this problem in the context of survival analysis, looking at the time until the
  earliest of several types of adverse outcomes (early death, involuntary hospitalization,
  jail booking)–we refer to this time duration as the adverse event time. We apply
  standard causal inference tools (T-learner, S-learner, and nearest neighbor matching)
  with various survival models to estimate individual and average treatment effects
  in terms of differences in mean adverse event times, where the treatment corresponds
  to medication non-adherence. We repeat our analysis using different amounts of longitudinal
  information available per individual (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using real data from
  a county’s administrative records, our results show strong evidence that medication
  non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse outcomes, advancing the onset of
  an adverse event by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies confirm that risk
  scores provided by the county account for key confounders, as their removal amplifies
  the estimated effects of non-adherence. Finally, subgroup analyses by medication
  formulation (injectable vs. oral) and by specific medication type consistently show
  that non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse outcomes. These findings underscore
  the clinical importance of medication adherence in delaying severe psychiatric crises
  and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can yield
  policy-relevant insights in complex healthcare settings. We caution that although
  we use causal inference tools, we only make associative claims; we discuss the validity
  of some assumptions that would enable us to rigorously convert our claims into causal
  ones.
