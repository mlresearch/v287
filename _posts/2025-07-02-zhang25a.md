title: Uncovering Knowledge Gaps in Radiology Report Generation Models through Knowledge
  Graphs
abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly improved
  the automatic generation of radiology reports. However, existing evaluation methods
  often focus on report-to-report similarities and fail to reveal the modelsâ€™ understanding
  of radiological images and their capacity to achieve human-level granularity in
  descriptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a system, named ReXKG, which extracts
  structured information from processed reports to construct a comprehensive radiology
  knowledge graph. We then propose three metrics to evaluate the similarity of nodes,
  distribution of edges, and coverage of subgraphs across various knowledge graphs.
  Using these metrics, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of AI-generated
  and human-written radiology reports, assessing the performance of both specialist
  and generalist models. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the capabilities
  and limitations of current AI models in report generation, offering valuable insights
  for improving model performance and clinical applicability.
