title: 'Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning of Clinical Scoring Tables: Adapting to Variations
  in Demography and Data'
abstract: Clinical scoring tables (e.g., CURB-65 for pneumonia severity and mortality
  estimation) are widely used for estimating outcomes in healthcare, but their applicability
  is limited by i) demographic variations, ii) incomplete data availability of clinical
  variables, or iii) the need to incorporate data of new cohort-relevant clinical
  variables. We introduce a novel constrained multi-objective evolutionary machine
  learning (ML) optimization framework, SET (Scoring-table Evolutionary Tuning), that
  fine-tunes established clinical scoring tables to enhance performance while maintaining
  familiarity. SET works by iteratively making small constrained changes to the original
  table to improve performance across multiple metrics, while maintaining a similar
  structure, ensuring that minimal adjustments are made. This is in contrast to ML-based
  proposals that replace scoring tables with entirely new models or tables, which
  may encounter barriers to clinical adoption. Extensive evaluations across 8 established
  scoring tables and cohorts demonstrate that SET allows existing clinically-trusted
  scoring tables to adapt to variations in demography, enhancing performance. We also
  show that in situations with incomplete data availability of key clinical variables,
  SET can still augment scoring tables and perform competitively. Additionally, SET
  can also augment existing tables to incorporate new cohort-relevant features.
