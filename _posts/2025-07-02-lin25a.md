title: A Case Study Exploring the Current Landscape of Synthetic Medical Record Generation
  with Commercial LLMs
abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer a valuable opportunity
  to create privacy-preserving and harmonized structured data, supporting numerous
  applications in healthcare. Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control
  over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations,
  and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individualsâ€™
  privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language
  Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant
  challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize
  across different hospitals, a long-standing issue in the field. In this work, we
  evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and
  investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these
  models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that
  while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of
  features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as
  the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize
  across diverse hospital settings.
