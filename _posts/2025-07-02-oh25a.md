title: Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Robust Domain Adaptation in Medical Time
  Series Analysis
abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different
  domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic distribution
  shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature representations, limiting
  their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics necessary for robust
  domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging multi-view
  contrastive learning to integrate temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics,
  and frequency-domain features. Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical
  fusion mechanism to learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable
  across domains while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse
  medical datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG),
  and electromyography (EMG), demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the robustness
  and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework offers a practical
  pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse healthcare settings.
