title: Global Deep Forecasting with Patient-Specific Pharmacokinetics
abstract: Forecasting healthcare time series data is vital for early detection of
  adverse outcomes and patient monitoring. However, it can be challenging in practice
  due to variable medication administration and unique pharmacokinetic (PK) properties
  of each patient. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid global-local
  architecture and a PK encoder that informs deep learning models of patient-specific
  treatment effects. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant
  accuracy gains in a blood glucose forecasting task using both realistically simulated
  and real-world data. Our PK encoder surpasses baselines by up to 16.4% on simulated
  data and 5.3% on real-world data for individual patients during critical events
  of severely high and low glucose levels. Furthermore, our proposed hybrid global-local
  architecture outperforms patient-specific PK models by 15.8%, on average.
