title: Predicting Partially Observed Long-Term Outcomes with Adversarial Positive-Unlabeled
  Domain Adaptation
abstract: 'Predicting long-term clinical outcomes often requires large-scale training
  data with sufficiently long follow-up. However, in electronic health records (EHR)
  data, long-term labels may not be available for contemporary patient cohorts. Given
  the dynamic nature of clinical practice, models that rely on historical training
  data may not perform optimally. In this work, we frame the problem as a positiveâ€“unlabeled
  domain adaptation task, where we seek to adapt from a fully labeled source domain
  (e.g., historical data) to a partially labeled target domain (e.g., contemporary
  data). We propose an adversarial framework that includes three core components:
  (1) Overall Alignment, to match feature distributions between source and target
  domains; (2) Partial Alignment, to map source negatives to unlabeled target samples;
  and (3) Conditional Alignment, to address conditional shift using available positive
  labels in the target domain. We evaluate our method on a benchmark digit classification
  task (SVHN-MNIST), and two real-world EHR applications: prediction of one-year mortality
  post COVID-19, and long-term prediction of neurodevelopmental conditions (NDC) in
  children. In all settings, our approach consistently outperforms baseline models
  and, in most cases, achieves performance close to an oracle model trained with fully
  observed labels.'
