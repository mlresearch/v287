title: Causal considerations can deterimine the utility of machine learning assisted
  GWAS
abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly employed to generate health related
  traits (phenotypes) for genetic discovery, either by imputing existing phenotypes
  into larger cohorts or by creating novel phenotypes. While these ML-derived phenotypes
  can significantly increase sample size, and thereby empower genetic discovery, they
  can also inflate the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent research has focused on
  developing estimators that leverage both true and machine-learned phenotypes to
  properly control false positives. Our work complements these efforts by exploring
  how the true positive rate (TPR) and FDR depend on the causal relationships among
  the inputs to the ML model, the true phenotypes, and the environment.  Using a simulation-based
  framework, we study causal architectures in which the machine-learned proxy phenotype
  is derived from biomarkers (i.e. ML model input features) either causally upstream
  or downstream of the target phenotype (ML model output). We show that no inflation
  of the false discovery rate occurs when the proxy phenotype is generated from upstream
  biomarkers, but that false discoveries can occur when the proxy phenotype is generated
  from downstream biomarkers. Next, we show that power to detect genetic variants
  truly associated with the target trait depends on its genetic component and correlation
  with the proxy trait. However, the source of the correlation is key to evaluating
  a proxy phenotype’s utility for genetic discovery. We demonstrate that evaluating
  machine-learned proxy phenotypes using out-of-sample predictive performance (e.g.
  test $R^2$) provides a poor lens on utility. This is because overall predictive
  performance does not differentiate between genetic and environmental components.
  In addition to parsing these properties of machine-learned phenotypes via simulations,
  we further illustrate them using real-world data from the UK Biobank.
