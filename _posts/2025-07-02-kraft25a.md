title: 'ALPEC: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework and Dataset for Machine Learning-Based
  Arousal Detection in Clinical Practice'
abstract: Detecting arousals during sleep is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders,
  yet the adoption of Machine Learning (ML) in clinical practice is hindered by a
  mismatch between clinical protocols and ML methods. Clinicians typically annotate
  only arousal onsets, whereas ML approaches conventionally rely on annotations for
  both the beginning and end. Moreover, no standardized evaluation methodology exists
  that is tailored to the specific needs of arousal detection in clinical practice.
  We address these challenges by proposing a novel post-processing and evaluation
  framework - Approximate Localization and Precise Event Count (ALPEC) - which optimizes
  arousal detectors to reflect operational priorities. We further advocate focusing
  on arousal onset detection and assess the impact of this on current training and
  evaluation schemes, addressing associated simplifications and challenges. Finally,
  we introduce a novel polysomnographic dataset that reflects the aforementioned clinical
  annotation constraints and includes modalities absent from existing datasets, demonstrating
  the benefits of leveraging multimodal data for arousal onset detection. Our contributions
  significantly advance the integration of ML-based arousal detection into clinical
  settings, narrowing the gap between technological advancements and clinical requirements.
