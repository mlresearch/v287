title: 'WatchSleepNet: A Novel Model and Pretraining Approach for Advancing Sleep
  Staging with Smartwatches'
abstract: Sleep monitoring is essential for assessing overall health and managing
  sleep disorders, yet clinical adoption of consumer wearables remains limited due
  to inconsistent performance and scarce open source datasets and transparent codebase.
  In this study, we introduce WatchSleepNet, a novel, open-source three-stage sleep
  staging algorithm. The model uses sequence-to-sequence architecture integrating
  Residual Networks (ResNet), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Long Short-Term
  Memory (LSTM) networks with self-attention to effectively capture both spatial and
  temporal dependencies crucial for sleep staging. To address the limited availability
  of high-quality wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) datasets, WatchSleepNet leveraged
  inter-beat interval (IBI) signals as a shared representation across polysomnography
  (PSG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) modalities. By pretraining on large PSG datasets
  and fine-tuning on wrist-worn PPG signals, the model achieved a REM F1 score of
  0.642 +/- 0.072 and a Cohenâ€™s Kappa of 0.684 +/- 0.051, surpassing previous state-of-the-art
  methods. To promote transparency and further research, we publicly release our model
  and codebase, advancing reproducibility and accessibility in wearable sleep research
  and enabling the development for more robust, clinically viable sleep monitoring
  solutions.
