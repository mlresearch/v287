title: Investigating Primary Care Indications to Improve the Quality of Electronic
  Health Record Data in Target Trial Emulation for Dementia
abstract: Missing data, inaccuracies in medication lists, and recording delays in
  electronic health records (EHR) are major limitations for target trial emulation
  (TTE), which uses EHR data to retrospectively emulate a clinical trial. EHR-based
  TTE relies on recorded data that proxy actual drug exposures and outcomes. While
  prior work has proposed various methods to improve EHR data quality, here we investigate
  the under-utilized consideration that encounters with a primary care provider (PCP)
  may result in more accurate data in the EHR. Patients with a PCP within the EHR
  network being studied tend to have more encounters overall and a greater proportion
  of the types of encounters that yield comprehensive and up-to-date records. By contrasting
  data for patients with and without a PCP in the considered EHR network, we demonstrate
  how PCP status affects EHR data quality. Through a case study, we then empirically
  examine the impact on TTE of including a PCP status feature either in the propensity
  score and outcome models or as an eligibility criterion for cohort selection, versus
  ignoring it. Specifically, we compare the estimated effects of two first-line antidiabetic
  drug classes on the onset of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementias. We find
  that the estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the consideration of PCP status,
  particularly when used as an eligibility criterion. Our work suggests that further
  researching the role of PCP status may improve the design of pragmatic trials.
