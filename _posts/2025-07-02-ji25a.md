title: 'ExOSITO: Explainable Off-Policy Learning with Side Information for Intensive
  Care Unit Blood Test Orders'
abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care
  unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the availability
  of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and costs associated with
  each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience frequent over-ordering
  of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden on both hospital resources
  and the environment. This paper develops a novel method that combines off-policy
  learning with privileged information to identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests
  to order. Our approach, EXplainable Off-policy learning with Side Information for
  ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO) creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians
  to order lab tests by considering both the observed and predicted future status
  of each patient.  We pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline
  data and a novel reward function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce
  a novel learning framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational
  data to bridge the gap between the optimal and logging policies.  The learned policy
  function provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting
  any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physicianâ€™s policy and prior approaches
  to this practical problem.
