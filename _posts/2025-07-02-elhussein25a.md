title: 'KEEP: Integrating Medical Ontologies with Clinical Data for Robust Code Embeddings'
abstract: 'Machine learning in healthcare requires effective representation of structured
  medical codes, but current methods face a trade-off: knowledge graph-based approaches
  capture formal relationships but miss real-world patterns, while data-driven methods
  learn empirical associations but often overlook structured knowledge in medical
  terminologies. We present KEEP (Knowledge-preserving and Empirically-refined Embedding
  Process), an efficient framework that bridges this gap by combining knowledge graph
  embeddings with adaptive learning from clinical data. KEEP first generates embeddings
  from knowledge graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively
  integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships. Evaluations
  on structured EHR from UK Biobank demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional
  and LLM-based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical
  outcomes. Moreover, KEEPâ€™s minimal computational requirements make it particularly
  suitable for resource-constrained environments.'
