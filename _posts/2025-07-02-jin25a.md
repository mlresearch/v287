title: Distributionally Robust Learning in Survival Analysis
abstract: We introduce an innovative approach that incorporates a $\textit{Distributionally
  Robust Learning (DRL)}$ approach into Cox regression to enhance the robustness and
  accuracy of survival predictions. By formulating a DRL framework with a Wasserstein
  distance-based ambiguity set, we develop a variant Cox model that is less sensitive
  to assumptions about the underlying data distribution and more resilient to model
  misspecification and data perturbations. By leveraging Wasserstein duality, we reformulate
  the original min-max DRL problem into a tractable regularized empirical risk minimization
  problem, which can be computed by exponential conic programming. We provide guarantees
  on the finite sample behavior of our DRL-Cox model. Moreover, through extensive
  simulations and real world case studies, we demonstrate that our regression model
  achieves superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness compared
  with traditional methods.
