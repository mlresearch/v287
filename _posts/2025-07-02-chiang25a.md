title: Learning Disease Progression Models That Capture Health Disparities
abstract: 'Disease progression models are widely used to inform the diagnosis and
  treatment of many progressive diseases. However, a significant limitation of existing
  models is that they do not account for health disparities that can bias the observed
  data. To address this, we develop an interpretable Bayesian disease progression
  model that captures three key health disparities: certain patient populations may
  (1) start receiving care only when their disease is more severe, (2) experience
  faster disease progression even while receiving care, or (3) receive follow-up care
  less frequently conditional on disease severity. We show theoretically and empirically
  that failing to account for disparities produces biased estimates of severity (underestimating
  severity for disadvantaged groups, for example). On a dataset of heart failure patients,
  we show that our model can identify groups that face each type of health disparity,
  and that accounting for these disparities meaningfully shifts which patients are
  considered high-risk.'
