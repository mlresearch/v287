title: Transformer Model for Alzheimer’s Disease Progression Prediction Using  Longitudinal
  Visit Sequences
abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
  that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is critical
  for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the disease. In this
  study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage of AD progression
  at a subject’s next clinical visit using features from a sequence of visits extracted
  from the subject’s visit history. We also rigorously compare our model to recurrent
  neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit
  (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess their performances based on factors such as the
  length of prior visits and data imbalance. We test the importance of different feature
  categories and visit history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transfomer-based
  model optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
  despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly in
  identifying converter subjects–individuals transitioning to more severe disease
  stages–an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal prediction.
  The results highlight the model’s potential in enhancing early diagnosis and patient
  outcomes.
