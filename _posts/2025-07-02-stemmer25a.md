title: Predicting Health States of Patients with Chronic Pain from Cellphone Usage
  Data
abstract: This study followed patients suffering from chronic pain and aimed to predict
  their health states. To this end, we conducted a clinical study in which patients
  were digitally monitored via clinically validated questionnaires (SF-36 and EQ-5D)
  and continuously collected cellphone usage data. We present a novel two-step approach
  for utilizing the immense amounts of unlabeled cellular logs in a supervised, binary
  classification problem and predicting patient-reported outcomes from objective cellphone
  usage data. Reaching an accuracy of 0.827 for women and 0.898 for men, our classification
  results show the feasibility of using cellphone monitoring data for patientsâ€™ state
  prediction. Such a capability may enrich periodic clinical assessments with frequent
  digital follow-ups, assist in disease management for chronic patients, and raise
  awareness whenever necessary.
