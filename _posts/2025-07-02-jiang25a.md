title: Learning Interactions Between Continuous Treatments and Covariates with a Semiparametric
  Model
abstract: 'Estimating the impact of continuous treatment variables (e.g., dosage amount)
  on binary outcomes presents significant challenges in modeling and estimation because
  many existing approaches make strong assumptions that do not hold for certain continuous
  treatment variables. For instance, traditional logistic regression makes strong
  linearity assumptions that do not hold for continuous treatment variables like time
  of initiation. In this work, we propose a semiparametric regression framework that
  decomposes effects into two interpretable components: a prognostic score that captures
  baseline outcome risk based on a combination of clinical, genetic, and sociodemographic
  features, and a treatment-interaction score that flexibly models the optimal treatment
  level via a nonparametric link function. By connecting these two parametric scores
  with Nadaraya–Watson regression, our approach is both interpretable and flexible.
  The potential of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations that
  show empirical estimation convergence. We conclude by applying our approach to a
  real-world case study using the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium
  (IWPC) dataset to show our approach’s clinical utility by deriving personalized
  warfarin dosing recommendations that integrate both genetic and clinical data, providing
  insights towards enhancing patient safety and therapeutic efficacy in anticoagulation
  therapy.'
